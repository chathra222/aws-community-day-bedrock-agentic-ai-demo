üìå What does the Playwright Self-Heal Agent do?
Think of it like a smart virtual QA engineer that:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Watches for failed end-to-end (E2E) tests.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzes the reason they failed.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Proposes a working fix ‚Äî automatically.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Validates the fix.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Creates a Pull Request (PR) for human review.

‚úÖ Here‚Äôs exactly what it does, in real steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ Detects Playwright test failures
The agent is triggered by your CI/CD pipeline.
When npx playwright test fails in GitHub Actions ‚Üí your workflow calls the agent orchestration (via Lambda).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Gathers all needed debugging context
Takes:

The error logs (failed_log.txt)

The DOM snapshot at failure time (dom_snapshot.html)

The original test file (sample.spec.ts)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Uses AI (Bedrock LLM) to understand the failure
Parses the logs:

What step failed?

What selector broke?

Looks at the DOM snapshot:

Did the HTML change?

Did a button label change?

Looks at the test code:

Which line needs to change?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Proposes a fix
The LLM writes:

An updated selector.

A new Playwright command.

A Git diff that shows exactly what changed.

Example:

diff
Copy
Edit
- await page.locator('button.submit').click();
+ await page.getByTestId('login-button').click();
5Ô∏è‚É£ Runs the fix safely
The agent orchestration uses a Lambda function to:

Apply the diff.

Re-run the test locally in a sandbox.

Check if the fix works.

If it passes, the agent knows the fix is valid.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Creates a new Pull Request
If the fix works, the agent:

Creates a new branch.

Commits the updated test file.

Pushes the branch.

Opens a GitHub PR.

Adds a comment with an explanation:
‚ÄúThis test was updated to fix a broken selector that failed due to a DOM change. Please review and merge.‚Äù

‚úÖ So what does the agent not do?
It doesn‚Äôt blindly merge the fix.

It doesn‚Äôt test business logic ‚Äî it only updates the failing Playwright script.

It relies on your CI/CD for final validation.
